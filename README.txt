**This program generates random messages**

*To make your program truly random,
the message that it outputs should be made up of
at least three different pieces of data*

    + 3 arrays of message excerpts.
    + A single object stores the 3 arrays.
    + Use a For...in loop to iterate the object's array properties and interpolate string.
    + Can display a single string or 3 seperate messages.

*Every time a user runs a program, 
they should get a new, randomized output.*

    + Final message cannot be the same as previous loop.
